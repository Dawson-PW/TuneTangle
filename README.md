# About me
Hi, I'm Dawson, I'm a 16 year old developer from Somerset, UK. I enjoy bodging things together on the side and hope they work! Don't expect my code to be in any way efficient, effective or that great to be honest, because up until now all of my projects have just been purely for me, not for commercial use (or really the public) so all I have been concerned about is if they work and have the functionality I need.
I am learning as I go and am always trying to learn to improve what I build and make.
